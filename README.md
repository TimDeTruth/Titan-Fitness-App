# Titan-Fitness-App
Comp 3717 Andriod Development course final term project

Worked in a team of 3 to develop a fitness app project using Java in Android Studio.
The premise of app was a time bassed fitness app that will count down and the goal of the user is to see how many reps they can perform. 
The time of each exercise is increased when the difficulty of the app is changed eg - easy to hard to extreme.
The app also graphically shows using a Pie Chart API of the portions and volume of your workout that you worked on categorzied by upper, lower and core exercises.
